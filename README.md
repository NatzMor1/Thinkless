# Thinkless: LLM Learns When to Think ðŸ¤–ðŸ’­

![Thinkless Logo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Thinkless-LLM%20Learns%20When%20to%20Think-blue)

Welcome to the **Thinkless** repository! This project focuses on exploring how large language models (LLMs) can learn when to engage in deeper thinking processes. Our goal is to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of LLMs by allowing them to discern when to analyze information more thoroughly.

## Introduction

In recent years, large language models have made significant strides in natural language processing. However, they still face challenges in determining when to "think" deeply about a problem. The **Thinkless** project aims to address this gap. By integrating mechanisms that allow LLMs to evaluate the complexity of tasks, we hope to improve their performance and reduce unnecessary processing.

## Background

As AI continues to evolve, the need for more intelligent decision-making in language models becomes critical. Traditional LLMs often treat every input with the same level of scrutiny, leading to inefficiencies. The **Thinkless** framework introduces a method for LLMs to assess the complexity of queries and decide when to allocate more resources to problem-solving.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Thinking**: Allows LLMs to assess when deeper analysis is necessary.
- **Improved Efficiency**: Reduces processing time by avoiding unnecessary computations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplifies interaction with the model for developers and researchers.
- **Open Source**: Contributions are welcome to enhance the project further.

## Installation

To get started with **Thinkless**, you need to clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NatzMor1/Thinkless.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Thinkless
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Once installed, you can start using the **Thinkless** model. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement it:

```python
from thinkless import ThinklessModel

# Initialize the model
model = ThinklessModel()

# Input your query
query = "What is the capital of France?"

# Get the response
response = model.process_query(query)

print(response)
```

For more advanced usage, check the documentation provided in the `docs` folder.
